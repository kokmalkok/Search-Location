# Search-Location
Application for searching location and set direction from user to last coordinates.
## **Current application using based kit: UIKit, MapKit, CoreLocationAnimation and also [FloatingPanel](https://github.com/scenee/FloatingPanel).**
About [FloatingPanel](https://github.com/scenee/FloatingPanel). This kit give developer posibilities to use panel like in Apple Map application for some custom stuff. I recommend everyone who making app with a lot elements.

## CocoaPods
Floating Panel is awailable through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). For those who want to install just pass through the link.

## **Main Objectives:**
1. Showing users location on map, central adress there the pin is and search bar in panel:

2. Searching for cities and show for location user searching:

4. Setup pin on custom place for show direction:

5. Setup pin on map while other elements is hidden for showing current adress name and number of building:

### Also secondary objectives, which was completed: 
- Create button to hide/unhide UI elements for some custom things;
- While user searching for something on map, user locations is temporarily not active for less using phone memory and battery charge;
- All UI setups made only by coding for practice and better setups.

### **Future Improvements:**
- "Favourite" page, where user can add his favourite places. There will show name place, location coordinates,country,city and street names and number of buildings;
- Possible objective to add side bar menu for better navigation;
- Add time direction while showing it and choose type of direction(auto,bicycle,walking and etc.);
- Show more than one search result in panel (there is some problem which i will solve in nearest future).
